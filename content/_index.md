There are a sequence of Tests (Test 1 through Test 6). The Test 
Plan containing the Test Cases and the Test Observations are found 
in [Test Plan and Results](/posts/my-first-post).

This website is as bare as I can make it created as per the Hugo Quickstart.

The Forestry.io configuration is also kept as simple as I can devise to fit the purpose.

Having executed the Test Plan and examined the results, I am tempted to suggest that
the root cause of my issue is as a result of an import to Forestry.io from GITHUB.
