a_number = 0
title = "Test 3 - Mandatory Number"

+++
This is a test where the document was created outside of Forestry using the TOML Front Matter format rather than the YAML format, committed to GIT and then imported
by Forestry.

The `a_number` front matter field was set to 0.

The Forestry Front Matter was also set to use the mandatoryNumberDefaultZero Template for this test.
