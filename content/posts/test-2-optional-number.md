This is a test where the document was created outside of Forestry using the TOML Front Matter format rather than the YAML format, committed to GIT and then imported
by Forestry.

The `a_number` front matter field was set to 0.

The Forestry Front Matter was also set to use the optionalNumberDefaultZero Template for this test.
